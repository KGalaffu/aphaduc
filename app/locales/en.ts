  **Our Mission**
  
  The Aphaduc Association is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving the quality of life of migrants and people in the process of naturalization. Located in Geneva, our mission is to encourage the social, economic, and educational integration of vulnerable populations through inclusive and sustainable initiatives.
  
  **Our History**
  
  Since our creation, we have engaged sustained efforts to establish innovative and relevant projects in response to the pressing needs of migrants and refugees in Switzerland, as well as disadvantaged and disabled children in Cameroon. Our strategic approach has allowed us to identify key initiatives that have a significant impact.
  
  We have actively worked to seek private funding to acquire land in Cameroon, on which we plan to build a Reception and Research Center. This center aims to provide essential support to children in difficulty, providing them with a safe environment as well as learning and development opportunities.
  
  In Geneva, we have also organized workshops and discussion forums in collaboration with lawyers specializing in immigrant rights. These enriching exchanges have strengthened our understanding of the challenges these populations face, allowing us to precisely target the gaps to be filled by our action.
  
  It is thanks to our unwavering commitment and determination that we have developed concrete solutions to support migrants and refugees in Switzerland, as well as abandoned or disabled children in Cameroon. We are convinced that it is crucial to equip these young people, whether they are seeking training or education, with the necessary tools to build a promising future.
  
  We firmly believe in the power of collaboration and synergy of efforts. We invite you to join us in this noble mission because together, we can create lasting changes and offer a better future to those who need it most.
